Introduction

This document provides guidance on deploying RIBBBITmedia VideoOnDemand (abbreviated as "rmvod") on a GNU/Linux host (or other UNIX-like system).  This document assumes the reader is sufficiently familiar with the target system to make any needed adjustments to the installation and configuration of the various packages on which rmvod is dependent.

The example deployment described in this document is performed on a Debian GNU/Linux system ("Buster" release / Debian 10).  Other systems may have other package management systems and filesystem configurations.  It is left as an exercise for the reader to recognize and reconcile any differences.

rmvod depends on several underlying packages.  In some cases, it may be possible to substitute other packages, and/or make customizations not described in this document, but the reader assumes all responsibility for integrating and troubleshooting any differences and/or customizations.



Dependent Packages

rmvod depends on the following (Debian APT) packages being installed:
python3 - interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version)
apache2 - Apache HTTP Server
libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3 - mod_wsgi for Apache2
mariadb-server - MariaDB database server (metapackage depending on the latest version)
python3-flask - micro web framework based on Werkzeug and Jinja2 - Python 3.x
python3-pymysql - Pure-Python MySQL Driver
python3-yaml - YAML parser and emitter for Python3

Note: Package names may be different, or packages may be unavilable on other systems.  The reader should be able to either reconcile these packages to equivalents on their system, or download and compile from source if needed.

Note: Python3 is included in the normal install of Debian GNU/Linux "Buster".  On a Debian system, using 'apt', attempting to install a package which is already properly installed will simply report the package as already installed, and skip it.  It is included here for readers who are either working on a "minimal install" or some other system which may not include Python3 in its default install.

As a sufficiently privileged user, issue the following command:
apt-get install python3 apache2 mariadb-server python3-flask python3-pymysql

This will report that additional packages will be installed.  Feel free to review the list of packages, and find out what each of them does, but understand that these are dependencies, and rejecting some or all of these dependencies will likely render rmvod inoperable.



Filesystem Changes

As a sufficiently privileged user, issue the following commands:
pushd /var/www/html && \
mkdir rmvod && \
cd rmvod && \
mkdir api css data dl img js vidsrc && \
mkdir img/poster_00 && \
popd
pushd /var/lib/ && \
mkdir rmvod && \
cd rmvod && \
mkdir py && \
mkdir bash; \
popd



Deploy rmvod Components

Download and untar the rmvod components, and from the base directory of the tarball which should contain the following directories: 

apache  bash  css  doc  html  img  js  license  py  sql

Execute the following commands as a sufficiently privileged user:

cp js/* /var/www/html/rmvod/js/ && \
cp img/* /var/www/html/rmvod/img/ && \
cp html/* /var/www/html/rmvod/ && \
cp css/* /var/www/html/rmvod/css/ && \
cp py/* /var/lib/rmvod/py/ && \
cp bash/* /var/lib/rmvod/bash/ && \
cp apache/sites-available/*  /etc/apache2/sites-available/ && \
chmod o+x /var/lib/rmvod/bash/*.sh && \
chmod o+x /var/lib/rmvod/py/*.sh 

Create the run-as user for the rmvod API

groupadd rmvod && \
useradd -g rmvod -d /var/lib/rmvod/py -s /bin/nologin rmvod  && \
chown rmvod:rmvod /var/www/html/rmvod/img/poster_00 


Web Server Configuration

a2enmod proxy_http2 proxy_http proxy ssl && \
pushd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled && \
rm ./* && \
ln -s ../sites-available/001-api-proxy.conf && \
popd && \
systemctl restart apache2



Database Setup

First, deploy the skeleton database.  As a sufficiently privileged user, from the base directory of the tarball (as above) execute the following command:

mariadb <  sql/vodlib_setup.sql 



Video Filestore

By default, rmvod expects the video files available for playback to be in /var/www/html/rmvod/vidsrc .

Beyond the vidsrc directory, the "filepath" attribute of the individual artifacts should be reflected in the vidsrc directory.  For example, if an artifact has a filepath attribute of "drama", then the video file should be in /var/www/html/rmvod/vidsrc/drama/ .

Normal *nix filesystem tricks apply.  The files could be stored on a remote file server and mounted via NFS or SMB.  The files could be stored on another local filesystem on the local machine.  Symbolic links should be followed with the Apache site configuration provided with rmvod
